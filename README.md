Image Dataset Organizer
This repository contains a Python script that facilitates the organization of image datasets based on labels specified in a CSV file. The script reads the CSV file to obtain the class IDs and corresponding labels. It then restructures the dataset by creating new folders named after the labels and populating them with the respective images from the original folders identified by the class IDs. This utility is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners working on machine learning and computer vision projects, helping them to streamline the preprocessing of large image datasets for model training and evaluation.

Key Features:

CSV-Based Labeling: Easily map class IDs to descriptive labels using a simple CSV file.
Automated Dataset Restructuring: Quickly reorganize your image dataset into folders named after the labels.
Batch Processing: Efficiently process large datasets with batch processing capabilities.
Zip Archive Creation: Automatically create a zip archive of the newly organized dataset for easy sharing and storage.
Usage Scenarios:

Preprocessing datasets for image classification tasks.
Organizing datasets for academic research and projects.
Streamlining the dataset preparation phase in machine learning pipelines.
